# REACT app to get insights of Github public profiles and public repositories of a user using the Github API

This project is hosted using github pages.

### Please visit: https://geetaingle.github.io/github-viewer/ to use this application.

In this project I have built an application using React ang Github api.

## To get started coding on this project, remember the following steps:

1. Clone this repository 
2. `npm install` first time after cloning the repository 
3. `npm start` to start developing the application

## Here's how the application looks like:

## How to use the application:

1. go to  https://geetaingle.github.io/github-viewer/
2. In the search box enter a username of the person to find his/her Github profile insights 
3. A page will load with information:
    - Profile Name
    - Avatar
    - Bio
    - Blogs
    - Location
    - Followers and Following count
    - Github repositories with their star count and description.
    - You can also click on some of the info to visit more links related to their profile 



## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
